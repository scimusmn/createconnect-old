# What is Create.Connect?
It’s a national, exhibit-based initiative that mixes the best of science-center interactives with the compelling stories and programs of a history museum. Its home base is at Conner Prairie Interactive History Park in Fishers, Indiana, where it’s been a test bed for a range of facilitation techniques and methods.

The activities and programs of Create.Connect were built around the idea that conversations—between family members and between staff and visitors—reveal points of personal relevance and connection. It’s in these conversations that museum visitors are bridging the subjects of science, technology, engineering and math and the people, places and events of history.

# How did it get started?
Create.Connect got its start at Conner Prairie, where staff and advisors saw a growing need for STEM-learning opportunities among their central Indiana audiences. In 2010 the museum created an initiative that would encourage visitors to explore, experiment, and experience the diverse ways that science, technology, engineering and math are woven into the daily life’s of Hoosiers past, present and future. The new initiative promised to fill the need for more informal STEM learning opportunities and attract a broader audience to Conner Prairie.

With funding from the National Science Foundation (2012 – 2016), Conner Prairie worked with the Science Museum of Minnesota to develop a 2,500 square-foot exhibit and related programming. The project reaches national audience through the participation of four history museums, each of which is hosting exhibits that include STEM-learning activities developed for Create.Connect.

# Who are the partners?
Create.Connect was developed through collaboration between Conner Prairie and the Science Museum of Minnesota. Four additional museums are participating in the project by hosting smaller versions of the exhibit that are adapted to local stories.

## Mystic Seaport—The Museum of America and the Sea
Mystic Seaport—The Museum of America and the Sea in Mystic, Connecticut is integrating a wind bench activity and various story components from Create.Connect to a larger exhibit called The Search for Speed.

## Oliver H. Kelley Farm
Oliver H. Kelley Farm, Minnesota Historical Society in Elk River, Minnesota is adding a wind energy activity and environments from Create.Connect to an exhibit for a new visitor center opening in 2016.

## California State Railroad Museum
California State Railroad Museum, California State Parks in Sacramento, California is producing an exhibit about the 1950s transition from steam-powered locomotives to diesel and electricity centered around two electricity and circuit activities from Create.Connect, opening June 19, 2015.

## Wabash County Historical Museum
Wabash County Historical Museum in Wabash, Indiana is highlighting a moment in history—the lighting of Wabash in 1880—to engage audiences in a circuit-building activity and story elements from Create.Connect.
